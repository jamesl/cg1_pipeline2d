Building:
on OSX:
make -f Makefile.osx
on Linux:
make

Running:
./main
./test
(wait patiently, it's not that fast)

Notes:

For some reason, my star looks a little different than
the one in the test program. I never could figure out
why. 

The program "test" runs through some different scenes
involving houses with different transformations. It
accomplishes this with the matrix stack.


The only difference I noticed on OS X vs. Linux is that
on Linux you could watch as it drew to the screen, but
on OS X you don't see anything until it has completed.
It's really slow, so it takes a while to do anything.
The window does not show up until the first screen has
completed doing anything.
